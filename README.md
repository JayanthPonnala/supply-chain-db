ðŸ“¦ Supply Chain Management Database
This project is a SQL-based database system for managing a global logistics and supply chain network. It tracks shipments from origin to destination across multiple warehouses and carriers.

The database stores key information about:

Shipments: including weight, content, date, sender, and receiver

Warehouses: location, capacity, and shipment storage history

Carriers: details of transportation providers by air, land, or sea

Clients: can be both senders and receivers

Employees: either warehouse staff or carrier crew (not both)

It supports complex logistics operations such as:

Multi-leg shipment routes with different carriers

Shipments passing through multiple warehouses (but stored in only one at a time)

Role-specific employee assignments

Cross-border shipping, customs, and cross-docking

The system is optimized for real-world logistics tracking, data integrity, and scalability.
